1. Accomplishments:
	Successfully set up web server index.js to execute API calls using unirest (we are working on converting to using express because it is more universal with Node.js)
	Successfully set up front end to get ingredients list from a user and to put list into a query string
	Enabled delete and edit capability after user has entered an ingredient
	When a user adds an ingredient the ingredient stays on the screen
2. Challenges:
	Converting from unirest framework to express
	Determining how to make entering, editing and deleting ingredients easiest for the user
	Deciding what to prioritize when returning a recipe list- we decided to prioritize by missed ingredients (least missed ingredients shown first) and next by most liked recipes
3. Goals for next week:
	Finish the recipe search API call to successfully return a list of recipes based on our decided priorities
	Get started on enabling the recipes API call to get recipes based on specific criteria such as dietary restrictions and cook time
	Get started on front end work to be able to test API calls more easily
