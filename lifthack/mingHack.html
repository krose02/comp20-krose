    <h1>Assignment 4 Write Up</h1>
    <h2 class = "title">Introduction</h2>
    <p class = "info"> For this assignment, I was given the task of hacking into my
                       Professor's implementation of a web application server. The purpose
                       of this assignment was to test the security strength of his application. </p>
    <h2 class = "title">Methodology</h2>
    <p class = "info">To achieve the task that I had been given, my approach to testing
                      the security strength of this application was see if I could enter
                      or edit any information that I wasn't supposed to have access to. To
                      do this, I used cross site scripting, curl, mongodb injeciton.</p>
    <h2 class = "title">Abstract of Findings</h2>
    <p class = "info">After testing the security strength of my professors application,
                      I came across a few issues that led to weaknesses in his product.
                      The most prevelant issue was data manipulation within his database.</p>
    <h2 class = "title">Issues Found</h2>
    <p class = "info"> 1) The most prevelant issue was that I was able to add passengners 
                       to the database he created. As an outside user, I shouldn't be able
                       to add or edit any of the information that is being held in the 
                       database for his application. One instance of be adding in data into
                       the database is below. I would classify this a a medium securty threat
                       because being able to insert false data is a serious issue but because 
                       existing data wasn't deleted or changed I wouldn't classify this a high 
                       risk. I found this area of weaknesses by inserting data using curl.
                       To prevent a hack like this from occuring again, Ming could secure
                       his app by making sure that only people with the appropriate credentials
                       can edit the data in the database.<br></p>

    <p class = "info">2) The second most relevant issue was an instance of bad programming practice.
                      In Ming's code, he has the list of vehicles in a JSON object in his code. If 
                      someone were to get visible access to his code, they would be able to see the 
                      data that they shouldn't have access to. Access to this list of vehicles could
                      enable a hacker to use that information to hack into the database, and manipulate 
                      even more data. To prevent this from happening, Ming could have put the data in 
                      a differet file and could have references it from the server.js file. I would level
                      this as a high security risk because data is blatantly displayed in the code.<br></p>
    <img src = "vehicles.png">
    <p class = "info">3) I couldn't find a third issue with Ming's code. With this point, I would like 
                         to highlight something he did that prevented a security breach. He made sure in his 
                         code to see if the "lat" and "lng" being passed into the databased were float numbers.
                         In doing this, he was able to prevent hackers from using the $ne opporator to bypass the 
                         system and insert bad data that could have been used to retrieve data from the database. This 
                         precaution that he took prevented a medium risk hack from occuring.<br> </p>

    <h2 class = "title">Conclusion</h2>
    <p class = "info">Overall, Ming's application was reasonably secure. He took some steps to prevent hackers
                      from accessing his data by checking that numbers inserted into the databse were floats
                      and he also didn't include his heroku username and password into his code while he was setting up
                      his mongodb database.
