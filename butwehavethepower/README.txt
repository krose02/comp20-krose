This is the README file for lab 5. In this lab, I provided lyrics for the song
underneath the video. To accomplish this, I used created a function in js to 
display certain lyrics depending on the time of the video. In order to track the
time of the video I used addEventLister(timeupdate,...) and the .currentTime.
