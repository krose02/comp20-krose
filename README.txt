The purpose of this git repository is to create a portfolio displaying all the 
work I did for this web programming class. My favorite assignment for this class
would be assignment number two: the LiftKnockOff. This is my favorite assignment 
because I was able to create a basic version of a ride sharing system, which is 
a very common method of transportation that people use. From the beginning of this 
course, my web programming capabilities have grown significantly. However, the biggest
benefit that I received from this course is having a better understanding of how 
the world works. Having guest speakers such as the two employers from Next Jump and
Robin from Career Services come in to speak to use on their area of work gave me a 
better understanding of where I want to pursue my capabilities after college. Now that
we have completed this course, I would like to focus my area of attention towards 
STEM education and how young girls can be better immersed into STEM fields.
